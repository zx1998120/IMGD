# 4 bit music generator 
This project is pretty much like a BGM generator based on the picture you can set up a picture in an 8x8 grid, and based on that, you can use your imagination to create a 4-bit music


# Position

This is an 8x8 grid; the zero means there are no pixels, leaving empty space around the features. And one means pixels on, and there is something on that grid.

# Music 
A 4-bit binary number can represent any value between 0 and 15 (in decimal). You can map these values to musical notes, where each number corresponds to a specific pitch or frequency.

	•	0000 → C
	•	0001 → D
	•	0010 → E
	•	0011 → F
	•	0100 → G
	•	0101 → A
	•	0110 → B
	•	0111 → C’ (octave above)
	•	1000 → D’
	•	1001 → E’
	•	1010 → F’
	•	1011 → G’
	•	1100 → A’
	•	1101 → B’
	•	1110 → C’’ (octave above)
	•	1111 → D’’

 # Challenge
 If I give you a 8x8 picture, can you create a 4 bit music for this one?
